Simply unlock melee weapons only, you can add melee weapons to map basis melee spawn in every map now.

## Cvar:
`l4d2_melee_spawn "" // Melee weapon list for unlock, use ',' to separate between names, e.g: pitchfork,shovel. Empty for no change 
l4d2_add_melee "" // Add melee weapons to map basis melee spawn or l4d2_melee_spawn, use ',' to separate between names. Empty for don't add`
